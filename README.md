This repository is dedicated to archiving the course materials for Text Mining, which I taught in the Department of Climate, Environment, and Energy Studies at Sookmyoung Women's University during the SS 2024 and the WS 2024. The course covers the following topics: 1) ***Basics of Python***, 2) Fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP), including ***Web Crawling and Preprocessing***, 3) Text Analysis techniques such as ***Word Cloud, TF-IDF, and Co-occurrence Analysis***, 4) ***Topic Modeling***, and 5) ***Time-Series Analysis***.

The four `Jupyter notebooks` contain lecture notes with explanations and practice exercises for each topic. The `scripts` folder includes the Python scripts for each step. The `materials` folder holds the resources used in the lecture.
